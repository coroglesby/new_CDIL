<h4>About the CDIL</h4>

<p>The Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) is a collaboration between the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) and the University of Idaho Library. Its purpose is to advance digital scholarship opportunities at the University of Idaho.

<h4 id="history">History</h4>

<p>CDIL began in 2015 as a series of meetings convened by Andrew Kersten, Dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS). These meetings brought together faculty from CLASS and the Library who were interested in advancing digital scholarship on campus and exploring collaborative research and teaching opportunities. In 2016, President Chuck Staben selected the CDIL as one of five campus projects, chosen from a pool of 43 applicants, to be awarded a Vandal Ideas Project (VIP) grant. The CDIL has used these funds, under the direction of Devin Becker, UI Library’s Head of Data & Digital Services and the CDIL’s first director, to outfit the physical center in the UI Library and to fund two different digital scholarship fellowship programs and two graduate research assistantships.</p>
